# MPLAB® Harmony X2C Model

## Introduction
MPLAB Harmony X2C Model enables rapid prototyping or model based development of a real time control embedded application using Scilab/Xcos + X2C within MPLAB Harmony 3 Embedded Software Development Framework. This model based development tool follows a hybrid approach where MPLAB Harmony 3 is used to configure and manage the target MCU and its I/O peripherals whereas a Scilab/Xcos + X2C is a model based development environment which is used to develop and manage the control algorithm running on the target MCU. 

X2C is an embedded library for model based development of control algorithms developed by Linz Center of Mechatronics. For more information on X2C, please visit their [website](https://x2c.lcm.at/)
