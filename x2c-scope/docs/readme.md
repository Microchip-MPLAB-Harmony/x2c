# MPLAB速 Harmony X2C Scope

## Introduction
X2C-Scope is a virtual oscilloscope tool developed by Linz Center of Mechatronics which allows run-time debugging or monitoring of your embedded application in MPLAB X IDE. This tool allows you to "Watch" or "Plot" any global variable in your embedded application at run-time i.e. without halting your CPU.

Using MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC), X2CScope can be seamlessly and automatically integrated into any Harmony 3 application. X2C-Scope uses UART to communicate with the target MCU allowing you to watch / update / plot a global variable in real-time.
